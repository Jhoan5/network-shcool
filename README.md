## About

Welcome to the Network School project! This endeavor is designed for a small network, connecting eight computers, one server (main computer), and a printer. The network is configured to provide wireless connectivity (inhalambric) and can easily accommodate additional devices as needed.

While this project primarily serves as a simulation, it can be translated into real-life implementation by swapping out components and identifying the necessary tools for your specific environment.

## System Requirements

- Cisco Packet Tracer v.8: Please note that this project is specifically designed for Cisco Packet Tracer version 8. It may not be compatible with later versions of the program.

## Getting Started

#### Clone this Repository

To clone this repository to your local machine, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tu-usuario/tu-repositorio.git
```

1. **Installation:**

   - Ensure you have Cisco Packet Tracer v.8 installed on your machine.
   - Download the project files and open the main file with Cisco Packet Tracer.

2. **Configuration:**

   - Familiarize yourself with the network components and their connections.
   - Explore the wireless capabilities and the potential for adding more devices.

3. **Simulation:**
   - Use Cisco Packet Tracer's simulation features to observe the network in action.
   - Troubleshoot and make adjustments as needed.

## Real-Life Implementation

If you're inspired to implement this network in a physical environment, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Procurement:**

   - Identify and acquire the necessary networking hardware, including routers, switches, computers, a server, and a printer.

2. **Software Setup:**

   - Install the required networking software on the server and computers.
   - Configure the devices with appropriate IP addresses and network settings.

3. **Wireless Integration:**

   - If wireless connectivity is desired, ensure that the necessary wireless access points or routers are procured and configured.

4. **Expandability:**
   - Plan for future expansion by selecting components that can easily accommodate additional devices.

> [!NOTE]
> Using Cisco Packet Tracer v.8. Compatibility with later versions of the program is not guaranteed.

### Example real project

1. Area: The project encompasses a rectangular room with dimensions of 10 meters by 5 meters.

2. Objective: The primary goal is to establish a robust wireless network that seamlessly connects multiple computers distributed across switches.

3. Network Topology: The chosen network topology for this setup is a tree structure, providing an organized and scalable architecture.

4. Number of Devices: The network is designed to accommodate a range of 8 to 20 devices, ensuring flexibility for future expansion.

5. Disposition: The layout and arrangement of devices within the room will be strategically planned to optimize wireless connectivity and accessibility. This includes considerations for placement of switches, routers, and access points to ensure uniform coverage.

6. Network Devices: The key network devices selected for this project include:
   Tp-link Archer C50: Serving as the central wireless router, the Tp-link Archer C50 provides high-speed connectivity and reliable performance.
   2 Tp-link 8-Port Switches: These switches facilitate the wired connections for the computers, ensuring efficient data transfer.

7. Materials: The necessary materials for this project include:
   Tp-link Archer C50 Wireless Router
   2 Tp-link 8-Port Switches
   30 meters of UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) Cable: Essential for establishing wired connections between devices.
   22 RJ45 Connectors: Used for terminating UTP cables and ensuring secure and reliable connections.
